# Notes of Algorithms

- [Notes of Algorithms, Part I](part-I/readme.md)
- [Notes of Algorithms, Part II](part-II/readme.md)

The notes are taken from the *Algorithms* course on Coursera ([Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)).

> This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
