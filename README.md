# Notes of Algorithms

The contents of notes come from the course *Algorithms* on Coursera ([Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)). This repository is for tracking of my own learning process, as well as for future reference.

> This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
