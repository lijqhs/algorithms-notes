# ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

[Seam Carving](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/seam/specification.php)

> Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row; a horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column. Below left is the original 505-by-287 pixel image; below right is the result after removing 150 vertical seams, resulting in a 30% narrower image. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image.

> Although the [underlying algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc) is simple and elegant, it was not discovered until 2007. Now, it is now a core feature in Adobe Photoshop and other computer graphics applications.

<summary>Basic solution idea.</summary>

- For horizontal case, add two virtual vertex in the left and right. Connect pixel from left to right.
- left vertex connected to every pixel in the column 0, energy as weights of edges; right vertex connected from every pixel in the column width-1, 0 as weights.
- every pixel point to three pixels in the next column, except topmost and bottommost which connect to two pixels, energy as weights of edges.
- find the shortest path from left to right vertex with `AcyclicSP`

</details>

NOTE: can be optimized without creating `EdgeWeightedDigraph` or `DirectedEdge` objects. use implicit digraph.

> Performance requirements. The width(), height(), and energy() methods should take constant time in the worst case. All other methods should run in time at most proportional to width Ã— height in the worst case. **For faster performance, do not construct explicit DirectedEdge and EdgeWeightedDigraph objects.**


<details>
<summary>Optimized solution idea.</summary>

- do not create Digraph objects
- use implicit digraph
- use the topological sort
- the analogue idea with *AcyclicSP*
